# Web mapping Z-3

This is a static website with an interactive map embedded. This site has about, privacy, terms, FAQ, and main pages. The main page is a Mapbox map that contains fake markers, each with a popup that shows short information. When the popup is opened, it shows a button to open an off-canvas that contains more details. The map also has a button to filter the markers based on color.
